# REACTJS_ FUNDAMENTAL_COURSE_FINAL TEST

This is the final assignment of my class reactjs fundamental.
This app was built following these requirements below: 

Demo: https://react-training-react.web.app/
Detail requirements: create a SPA which has
A Navbar on the top (See the demo): https://react-training-react.web.app/
Home page: you only need to display some dummy text in this page.
Posts page: use this API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts to get all posts available then display in the table.
The posts page should support search by title. User can sort the table by clicking into the headers.
User can be able to delete a row of table or clicking on show detail to see the detail of the post.
Post page: given the post_id in url, this page should show the detail of the post. Example: if user enter the link posts/3 then the post with id =3 should be displayed.
Login page: A Login Form which 2 inputs: email and password. User must enter an valid email and password require at least 8 characters. Use this mock API: https://60dff0ba6b689e001788c858.mockapi.io/tokens to create token after login
successfully.
Profile page: if user has not logged before, this page should display the login form. If user logged in already, then display profile of user by using this mock API
https://60dff0ba6b689e001788c858.mockapi.io/users/:userId (which userId can be get after login successfully).
After login successfully, all the API request should include Authorization token in the header.
If user logged in then there is a "logout" button.
You can use any third-party library, using UI library is welcomed.
